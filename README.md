# *-kanren

My attempt at a tiny miniKanren/uKanren in Python, inspired by [Hello Declarative World](https://codon.com/hello-declarative-world)'s Ruby, and a very careful reading of the original Reasoned Schemer's appendix.  It's fairly undocumented for now, but does appear to work, as far as I can tell.

If I can get inequality constraints in, the possibility of [generating quines](http://webyrd.net/quines/quines.pdf) will be within reach.
