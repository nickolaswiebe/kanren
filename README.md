# *-kanren

My attempt at a tiny miniKanren/uKanren with inequality and type constraints in Python, inspired by [Hello Declarative World](https://codon.com/hello-declarative-world)'s Ruby, and a very careful reading of the original Reasoned Schemer's appendix.  It's fairly undocumented for now, but does appear to work, as far as I can tell.
